# YouTube-Search-Engine
*Initally coded in August, 2020.*

This project was done as a part of the course: https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Web-Development/Learn-Projects-In-JavaScript-And-JQuery

I use the YouTube API to create a YouTube Search Engine with the help of the FancyBox JQuery plugin.

In addition to what was covered in the course, I have edited the CSS to my liking and even altered the Javascript file where suitable.
